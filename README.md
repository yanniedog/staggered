# Trading Plan Calculator

An interactive, browser-based tool for designing and stress-testing staged buy and sell ladders. The interface couples capital allocation controls with rich visualisations so traders can iterate on execution plans, quantify fees, and export a complete run-book.

## Features
- Guided configuration form for capital, ladder width, skew, and rung count with instant plan recalculation.
- Advanced mode supporting sell-only adjustments, equal-quantity overrides, absolute vs. relative spacing, and configurable trading fees (percent or fixed) with settlement controls.
- Dual D3-powered charts that visualise buy and sell ladders, including hover tooltips and executed rung tracking.
- Detailed buy/sell order tables with progressive averages, fee disclosure, and net profit projections.
- Snapshot exports to CSV, XLS, and PDF powered by `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` for downstream reporting.
- Responsive Tailwind CSS layout optimised for desktop and mobile review.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have a modern desktop browser (latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a lightweight HTTP server for local development:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Adjust the configuration sliders and advanced options; the plan summary, charts, and ladders update automatically on every change.

## Exporting Plans
- Use the **Export Options** menu to download CSV, XLS, or PDF snapshots.
- CSV/XLS exports include current settings, summary metrics, and side-by-side ladders.
- PDF export captures the on-screen layout (configuration, charts, and tables) for quick sharing.

## Architecture Notes
- `index.html` contains the full application: Tailwind CSS (CDN), D3.js (v7), `html2canvas`, and `jsPDF` are loaded from trusted CDNs.
- The script maintains a single source of truth for ladder calculations, ensuring charts, tables, and exports share consistent data.
- Sell-only workflows clone baseline buy ladders, track executed rungs, and derive existing positions for accurate profit and fee calculations.

## Development Tips
- Keep browser dev tools open to monitor console logs and verify there are no warnings/errors while editing.
- When extending the calculator, preserve DRY principles by updating shared helpers (formatting, fee handling, export builders) instead of duplicating logic.
- If you introduce new dependencies, prefer CDN builds compatible with static hosting since the project is currently serverless.
